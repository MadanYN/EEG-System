# EEG-System
The aim of the project is to develop an ELectroencephalogram(EEG) Acquisition System that
is capable of monitoring brain activity through 24 different channels simultaneously. The system should convey the captured data in real-time to a computer over Bluetooth and the receiver should plot waveforms of all the channels. The design is inspired by the OpenBCI Cyton/Ganglion biosensing board, which is a well-known and widely used EEG system.
